<h4 id="website"><strong>Website</strong></h4>

<p>I always wanted to be able to create a simple website. Fab Academy has been the right personal motivation. I did a simple website with the essential information but I plan to expand it during this semester. I would have more time to make my blog nicer, but during this semester I’ll definitely do it. I always think how to do my things better. Usually when I finish doing my job I start thinking how to do better the same thing. Here below some of useful tips I found to understand website tools.<br />
I used Jekyll, bootstrap and a text editor. In the beginning I had some difficulties to understand which is the role of Jekyll (what it does) and bootstrap. Now I can simply say that Jekyll create the baseline structure of the directories for a static website. It also takes as input the markdown (.md) files and convert them in html files to generate the static website. Bootstrap is a collection of lines of code ready to use. If you are looking for a navbar you can find some lines of code that you simply cut and paste into your .html file. I tried to use a theme as it was, but I was not satisfied. I wanted to understand the relation between every single part of the code lines and what I can see on my website. With the help of this <a href="http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial">tutorial</a> I understood how to build my personal theme.</p>

<p>I also understood how useful is the word <code>layout</code> in the first lines of each .md file. You can build different layouts for your web pages (posts, default, news etc..) and all you have to do to choose a layout for your web page is to write the value of the variable <em>layout</em>. 
For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">layout</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">page</span></code></pre></div>

<p>or if you want to change it to the default one you simply have to write:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="ss">layout</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">default</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Every layout needs a html file which describes the structure of the layout. Inside the html files in <code>_layouts</code> directory you can find</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">\{\</span><span class="o">%</span> <span class="kp">include</span> <span class="n">my</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">navbar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span> <span class="p">\</span><span class="o">%</span><span class="p">\}</span></code></pre></div>

<p><code>include</code> is a simple way to avoid cut and paste every time the same code if you decide that (for example) the navigation bar of your website always has to be there in every single web page. In this way you haven’t to write the same code but only the same <code>include</code> line and Jekyll will do the job for you. Going ahead you can compose your layout choosing a sidebar, a footer and more. I saw you can also use <code>for</code> cycle but I will test it when I add the news section in my webpage.<br />
Using this few notions I built my webpage with a navbar, a sidebar and a footer. In the navbar I wanted to add a dropdown menu and I learnt that I need to add one line for javascript:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">script</span> <span class="n">src</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;&lt;</span><span class="sr">/script&gt;`</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In the line above you can also see <code>site.baseurl</code> which is a global variable you can find in <code>_config.yml</code> file which is used by Jekyll. This url will be the root of my web page, that is the one in my fab academy archive.<br />
There also two important lines inside the template:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;stylesheet&quot;</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;text/css&quot;</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>These are useful to use style sheets (CSS). I learnt something about CSS using the tutorial below. There are also other useful links I used to understand better jekyll and bootstrap.</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML5 and CSS: I have done this <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/web">tutorial</a> and I found it very useful.</li>
  <li>I found some difficulties installing Jekyll on Linux Mint, but after installing <em>ruby-full</em> following these <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installa```tion/#apt">instructions</a> I solved it.</li>
  <li>This has been a very useful tutorial to <a href="http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/tutorial">understand jekyll step-by-step</a></li>
  <li>Bootstrap: at first I was a little bit confused but I found this <a href="www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/">tutorial</a> and it was very useful. It is a step-by-step guide and there are many little interactive code examples.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I wanted to add a little detail in sidebar to underline that assignments are homework. I added the pencil icon using:<br />
<code>class="glyphicon glyphicon-home"</code><br />
I think it’s really nice <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-thumbs-up"></span></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="control-version-systems"><strong>Control Version Systems</strong></h4>

<p>With <strong>Github</strong> and <strong>Mercurial</strong> I had some little problems but I solved them with some pratice and the tutorial I followed in the <a href="http://fabacademy.fablabcascina.org/classes/index.html">pre-class lessons</a> by our local instructor.</p>

<h4 id="video-lesson"><strong>Video lesson</strong></h4>

<p>I loved the way of thinking of Neil about working at “low level” also because I like to understand how things work in depth. I liked working with a simple text editor to create the website. I chose <a href="http://www.geany.org/">Geany</a> but I also like nano on command-line. I like command-line because I started working on  old <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/Commodore64.jpg">Commode64</a> and I remember when I had an old PC <a href="http://www.computergraffiti.it/pcs286/pcs286g.jpg">Olivetti 286</a>. Afterwards, obviuosly, I played sometime with <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> and then a little bit with Linux. Now I really want to go in depth with Linux.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="something-about-project-ideas"><strong>Something about project ideas</strong></h4>

<p>I found some difficulties about choosing my final project just because I’d like to do many things :)<br />
Here it is the list of the projects I thought:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Auto sat finder tracking</strong>: a platform on which you can put a dish antenna and automatically it point to the right satellite.</li>
  <li><strong>Portable radio bridge</strong>: I thought about something very light to carry. A mountable light trellis made of wood, something like a kit. Eventually with motors to help to lift up higher. Obviously an auto point system with the other far end of radio bridge.</li>
  <li>A <strong>ground vehicle</strong>, a mobile platform which is able to go even in the worst countryside. Eventually autonomous with an auto “go back home” system when battery goes low. Obviously it has to stream video in real-time and you also can drive it remotely.</li>
  <li>A  <strong>wireless rechargeable system</strong>: I like the idea to go in depth on induction recharge.</li>
  <li>I also like the world of <strong>wireless sensor networks</strong> and IoT, even because I studied something for one year. Regarding this idea I hope that with the project I chose I will have more knowledge to be able to do a wearable underwater network. It could be useful to monitor scuba divers during immersion.</li>
  <li>I also would have liked to do some <strong>toys for children</strong>. I think that it is very funny and I’d like to do a funny toy for my nephew :) Anyway, my project could also be even a very funny toy :)</li>
  <li>I liked the <strong><a href="http://academy.cba.mit.edu/2012/students/rodriguez.alejandro/project%20presentation.html">pick and place machine</a></strong> for SMD electronics components. I think one day I’ll try to do it.</li>
  <li>In the end, I wanted to do a <strong>video door phone</strong> for my parent’s house. In the last months I am a little bit worried about thefts in houses. Furthermore I’d like to go in depth in home security systems which can give a feeling of more safety. For this reason I installed some IP cam in my house but we still don’t have a video door phone.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="website-restyling"><strong>Website restyling</strong></h4>
<p>This year I decided to improve my website. I decided to have more space then I removed the sidebar and you can find the list of assignment both in homepage using the figures or even in a dropdown menu on top in the navbar. 
This is the <a href="http://k0ral78.github.io/old-fab-2015-blog/">old website</a> I did in 2015. If you observe the link you can also notice that this year I learnt something I wanted to learn last years..that is how to have multiple blogs on github with one account but multiple repositories. 
I wrote down a <a href="#multiple-pages-hosted-with-github-mini-tutorial">mini-tutorial</a> to do it.
My new website is the one where you are now. I used one bootstrap them and I modified just a bit html files to have what I wanted. Now I am almost satisfied.. I always have new ideas about improving the website. Here is my to-do list.</p>

<p><strong>TODO list</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>add RSS feed (maybe some of my friend want to follow me using RSS feed)</li>
  <li>automatic twit or facebook posting when I upload new page with new (I hope) successful assignment</li>
  <li>add a badge to the images of the assignment to graphically showing if they are completed</li>
  <li>add a column in each assignment page for self-evaluation. I saw it <a href="http://archive.fabacademy.org/2016/fablabtecsup/students/363/content/assignments/assignment-1.html">here</a> and I appreciated it</li>
  <li>add google analytics to check how much visits I have on my website</li>
  <li>add comments to assignments webpages (facebook comments? which is the best way for comments?)</li>
  <li><del>add new font</del> <a href="#how-to-add-new-font">how to add new font</a></li>
  <li><del>Refine responsiveness:</del> some web elements were not responsive.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I’ll refine this list..adding or removing items. 
I also found really useful using free-distraction mode when I work… It consists in using full screen view in all the programs I can. I think it helps!
In the end, I want to write down that I found <a href="http://meldmerge.org/">meld</a> useful. It helps to find textual differences between two files. Thanks to it I understood why my html index.html gave me some problems of alignment. I compared it with the original index of bootstrap template and I found that cutting and pasting..I forget to close some tags..
Here below I’ll let you appreciate a screenshot of meld where you can see the simplicity but also the power of meld.</p>

<p><img src="/img/meld.jpeg" alt="meld" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>

<p>As you can see is really simple finding differences between two files. 
<br /> 
<br /></p>

<h4 id="how-to-add-new-font"><strong>How to add new font</strong></h4>

<p>If you want to look for a new font there are many ways. I started from this <a href="https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/google-web-fonts/">page</a> to choose from a list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I chose <em>Noto Serif</em> font</li>
  <li>I added the specific address</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">link</span> <span class="n">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Serif&#39;</span> <span class="n">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;stylesheet&#39;</span> <span class="n">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;text/css&#39;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>for this font in the file where I have<code>head</code>tag
- I modify in the css file (bootstrap.min.css) I have in <code>head</code> tag the font-family used in <code>body</code> tag.
You can see the difference below..it’s a slight difference, but I think this font is more readability. You can observe how the capital letter I has changed. 
<br /></p>

<p><img src="/img/pre-new-font.jpeg" alt="pre-new-font" width="100%" height="100%" />
<img src="/img/post-new-font.jpeg" alt="post-new-font" width="100%" height="100%" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4 id="git-tutorials"><strong>Git tutorials</strong></h4>
<p>First of all a basic git tutorial about how upload my website to fabacademy repository. After I’ll describe how to have multiple pages (or blogs or static websites) hosted on github.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="fabacademy-git-tutorial"><strong>Fabacademy git tutorial</strong></h5>
<p>After what I learnt last year <a href="#control-version-systems">here</a>, I added some information about Git. I found a summary of useful commands using command line. 
First of all a basic tutorial specific for FabAcademy starting from scratch and using linux command line.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install Git and ssh:</li>
</ul>

<p><code>
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install ssh
</code></p>

<ul>
  <li>Check if a public key is already available</li>
</ul>

<p><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code></p>

<p>If you don’t have it then generate it with:</p>

<p><code>ssh-keygen</code></p>

<p>After this, again with
<code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>
it is possible to see the ssh key and copy and paste it into the git fabacademy  profile.
In order to add the key I had to sign in at <a href="http://git.fabacademy.org/">gitfabacademy</a> with user and password that the instructor gave to each of us. 
Then in profile settings I added ssh key pasting it.
At this point I have to clone the repository, adding my folder (<strong>my ID is 475</strong>), adding all files and committing.  After it I can push my website in the repository. 
Before any commit it is important to pull to get an updated version of the archive.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h5 id="multiple-pages-hosted-with-github-mini-tutorial"><strong>Multiple pages hosted with Github mini tutorial</strong></h5>
<p>How to have multiple pages hosted on Github. I’ll use my <a href="http://k0ral78.github.io/old-fab-2015-blog/">old website</a> as example. I would like to have also my old website on github, but I can only have one website in main web address <a href="k0ral78.github.io">k0ral78.github.io</a>. For this reason I moved the old website in a <a href="http://k0ral78.github.io/old-fab-2015-blog/">secondary page</a> and the new website in the <a href="http://k0ral78.github.io/">main one</a><br />
Few steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>go online and create a new repository: the name of my repository is <code>old-fab-2015-blog</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>go locally in your terminal and initialize your repository with <code>git init</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>add the repository created in first step as <strong>remote</strong> for our local git project. We can have many different remote repository for our project, each with a symbolic name. In our case we use the <em>origin</em> name.
<code>git remote add origin 
https://github.com/k0ral78/old-fab-2015-blog.git</code>
Next steps are better described <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually/">here</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create a branch called <em>gh-pages</em>: <code>git checkout --orphan gh-pages</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, BEFORE doing everything else, is important to modify <code>site.baseurl</code> in <code>_config</code> with the name of the repository you created in first step (that is old-fab-2015-blog). If you don’t do it, you’ll have problems with paths..that is, if you have picture in a specific path you’ll see that the picture won’t be loaded in the webpage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>rebuild website: <code>jekyll build</code>.</li>
  <li>add, commit and push files
  <code>add --all</code>
  <code>git commit -m "my comment"</code>
  <code>git push -u origin gh-pages</code></li>
  <li>Check that you website is online! 
My old website is at <a href="http://k0ral78.github.io/old-fab-2015-blog/">http://k0ral78.github.io/old-fab-2015-blog/</a></li>
